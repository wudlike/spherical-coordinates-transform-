## spherical-coordinates-transform
### Description:

* **Goal**ï¼šAssuming that the initial coordinates are $(\theta,\phi)$ (corresponding to longitude and latitude, respectively.), compute
the new position after moving a given length $\ell$ at an angle of $\psi$ with the longtitude. (see [Chinese note](https://blog.csdn.net/Mr_Cat123/article/details/86507183))
* **Return:** New positon and new angle between the vector and longtitude
